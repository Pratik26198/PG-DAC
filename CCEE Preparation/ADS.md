3. **Binary Search**
   ```
   Pseudocode:
   BinarySearch(arr, x):
       start = 0
       end = length(arr) - 1
       while start <= end:
           mid = (start + end) // 2
           if arr[mid] == x:
               return mid
           elif arr[mid] < x:
               start = mid + 1
           else:
               end = mid - 1
       return -1
   ```

### Recommendations for Use
- Use sorting algorithms based on dataset size and requirements for stability.
- Choose efficient graph algorithms for large datasets.
- Opt for hashing in scenarios requiring frequent lookups.
