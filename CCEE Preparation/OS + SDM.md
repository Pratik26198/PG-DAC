# Operating System Basics

## What is an Operating System (OS)?

An **Operating System (OS)** is system software that acts as an intermediary between computer hardware and application software. It provides an environment in which application programs can run and facilitates user interaction with the hardware.

### Difference Between OS and Application Software:
| **Feature**           | **Operating System (OS)**                                   | **Application Software**                           |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**            | Manages hardware resources and provides a platform for application software. | Performs specific tasks for the user.            |
| **Dependency**         | Runs directly on hardware.                                 | Runs on top of the OS.                           |
| **Examples**           | Windows, Linux, macOS                                     | Microsoft Word, Google Chrome, Photoshop        |

### Why is OS Hardware-Dependent?
The OS interacts directly with the hardware via drivers and kernel-level instructions. Since hardware architectures (x86, ARM, etc.) and device capabilities vary, an OS must be designed to utilize the specific features and instruction sets of the target hardware.

### Important Directories in Linux:
| **Directory** | **Purpose**                                                                 |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `/`           | Root directory. Starting point of the file system hierarchy.               |
| `/home`       | Contains user directories. Example: `/home/user1` for user-specific data.  |
| `/etc`        | Configuration files for the system and software.                           |
| `/bin`        | Essential binaries (commands like `ls`, `cp`, `mv`).                       |
| `/var`        | Variable files like logs and caches.                                       |
| `/tmp`        | Temporary files created by processes.                                      |
| `/dev`        | Device files for accessing hardware (e.g., disks, USBs).                   |

### Redirection and Pipes

#### Redirection Operators:
| **Operator** | **Description**                          | **Example**                      |
|--------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| `>`          | Redirects output to a file (overwrites). | `echo "Hello" > file.txt`        |
| `>>`         | Appends output to a file.                | `echo "World" >> file.txt`       |
| `<`          | Takes input from a file.                | `cat < file.txt`                 |

#### Pipes (`|`):
- Used to pass the output of one command as input to another.
- **Example**: `cat file.txt | grep "search_term"`

## File Permissions and How to Set Them

Linux uses a permission model to manage access to files and directories. Permissions are represented as **rwx** (read, write, execute) for the owner, group, and others.

### Permission Format:
```
-rwxr-xr--  1 user group 1234 Jan 14 10:30 file.txt
```
| **Field**    | **Meaning**                  |
|--------------|------------------------------|
| `-`          | File type (`-` for file, `d` for directory). |
| `rwxr-xr--`  | Permissions (owner, group, others).          |
| `user`       | File owner.                                  |
| `group`      | File group.                                  |

### Setting Permissions with `chmod`:
- **Symbolic Method**: `chmod u+x file.txt` (adds execute permission for the owner).
- **Octal Method**: `chmod 754 file.txt`
  - `7`: Full (rwx).
  - `5`: Read and execute (r-x).
  - `4`: Read-only (r--).

### Changing Ownership with `chown`:
- Syntax: `chown user:group file.txt`

---

## Access Control List (ACL)
ACL provides fine-grained permissions beyond the traditional model.
- **Set ACL**: `setfacl -m u:user1:rw file.txt`
- **View ACL**: `getfacl file.txt`

---

## Network Commands

| **Command**  | **Description**                                  | **Example**                  |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| `telnet`     | Connects to a remote host using Telnet protocol. | `telnet 192.168.1.1`         |
| `ftp`        | Transfers files using FTP protocol.              | `ftp ftp.example.com`        |
| `ssh`        | Secure shell login to a remote machine.          | `ssh user@hostname`          |
| `sftp`       | Secure file transfer using SSH.                  | `sftp user@hostname`         |
| `finger`     | Displays user information.                       | `finger username`            |

---

## System Variables (e.g., PS1, PS2)

### Common System Variables:
| **Variable** | **Description**                                  |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `PS1`        | Primary prompt string. Customizes the shell prompt. |
| `PS2`        | Secondary prompt string (used for multi-line commands). |

### Setting System Variables:
- Temporarily: `export PS1="\u:\w\$ "` (Custom prompt).
- Permanently: Add to `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`.

# Shell Programming in Linux

## What is a Shell?

A **shell** is a command-line interpreter that provides a user interface for accessing the services of the operating system. It processes commands entered by the user and executes them, either directly or by passing them to the appropriate program.

### Types of Shells in Linux
| **Shell**      | **Description**                                                                                  |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Bash**        | Bourne Again Shell, the most widely used shell. Supports scripting and advanced features.       |
| **Zsh**         | Z Shell, similar to Bash but with additional features like themes and plugins.                  |
| **Ksh**         | Korn Shell, combines features of the C Shell and Bourne Shell.                                  |
| **Tcsh**        | T C Shell, an enhanced version of the C Shell with scripting improvements.                      |
| **Fish**        | Friendly Interactive Shell, designed for user-friendliness and simplicity.                      |

---

## Shell Variables

Shell variables are placeholders that store data used by shell scripts and commands.

### Types of Variables
1. **System Variables**: Predefined variables maintained by the shell.
   - Examples: `$HOME`, `$PATH`, `$USER`
2. **User-Defined Variables**: Custom variables created by the user.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     MY_VAR="Hello"
     echo $MY_VAR
     ```

### Scope of Variables
- **Local Variables**: Available within the current shell or script.
- **Environment Variables**: Available to all processes started from the shell.

---

## Wildcard Symbols

Wildcards are symbols used to represent patterns in filenames or strings.

| **Symbol** | **Description**                           | **Example**                |
|------------|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| `*`        | Matches zero or more characters.          | `ls *.txt` (all `.txt` files) |
| `?`        | Matches exactly one character.            | `ls file?.txt`            |
| `[ ]`      | Matches any one character within brackets.| `ls file[1-3].txt`        |

---

## Shell Meta Characters

Meta characters have special meanings in the shell and are used for various operations.

| **Character** | **Description**                                   | **Example**                |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| `;`           | Separates multiple commands in a single line.    | `ls; pwd`                 |
| `&`           | Executes a command in the background.            | `sleep 10 &`              |
| `|`           | Pipes output of one command to another.          | `ls | grep file`          |
| `>`           | Redirects output to a file (overwrites).         | `echo "data" > file.txt`  |
| `>>`          | Redirects output to a file (appends).            | `echo "more data" >> file.txt` |
| `<`           | Redirects input from a file.                     | `wc < file.txt`           |
| `\`           | Escapes special characters.                      | `echo \$HOME`             |

---

## Command Line Arguments

Command-line arguments allow users to pass inputs to scripts when executing them.

### Example Script
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Script Name: $0"
echo "First Argument: $1"
echo "Second Argument: $2"
echo "All Arguments: $*"
echo "Number of Arguments: $#"
```

### Run the Script
```bash
./script.sh arg1 arg2
```

**Output**:
```
Script Name: ./script.sh
First Argument: arg1
Second Argument: arg2
All Arguments: arg1 arg2
Number of Arguments: 2
```

---

## `read` and `echo` Commands

### `read` Command
Used to take input from the user during script execution.
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Enter your name:"
read name
echo "Hello, $name!"
```

**Run**:
```
$ ./script.sh
Enter your name:
John
Hello, John!
```

### `echo` Command
Used to display messages or output values of variables.
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "This is a shell script!"
VAR="Linux"
echo "Welcome to $VAR"
```

**Output**:
```
This is a shell script!
Welcome to Linux
```

else
    echo "Invalid directory!"
fi
```
# Advanced Shell Programming in Linux

## Decision Loops in Shell Programming

### 1. `if-else` Statement
The `if-else` statement is used to execute a block of code based on a condition.

#### Syntax:
```bash
if [ condition ]; then
    # Code to execute if condition is true
else
    # Code to execute if condition is false
fi
```

#### Example:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
read -p "Enter a number: " num
if [ $num -gt 0 ]; then
    echo "Positive number"
else
    echo "Non-positive number"
fi
```

---

### 2. `test` Command
The `test` command is used to evaluate expressions.

#### Example:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
if test $1 -gt 0; then
    echo "$1 is greater than zero"
else
    echo "$1 is less than or equal to zero"
fi
```

---

### 3. Nested `if-else`
Nested `if-else` allows multiple conditions to be checked.

#### Example:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
read -p "Enter your age: " age
if [ $age -lt 18 ]; then
    echo "You are a minor."
elif [ $age -lt 65 ]; then
    echo "You are an adult."
else
    echo "You are a senior citizen."
fi
```

---

### 4. `case` Statement
The `case` statement is used for multiple conditional checks.

#### Syntax:
```bash
case expression in
    pattern1)
        # Code for pattern1
        ;;
    pattern2)
        # Code for pattern2
        ;;
    *)
        # Default case
        ;;
esac
```

#### Example:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
read -p "Enter a day of the week: " day
case $day in
    "Monday")
        echo "Start of the work week!"
        ;;
    "Friday")
        echo "Almost weekend!"
        ;;
    *)
        echo "Have a great day!"
        ;;
esac
```

---

### 5. `while` Loop
The `while` loop runs as long as the condition is true.

#### Syntax:
```bash
while [ condition ]; do
    # Commands
done
```

#### Example:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
count=1
while [ $count -le 5 ]; do
    echo "Count: $count"
    count=$((count + 1))
done
```

---

### 6. `until` Loop
The `until` loop runs as long as the condition is false.

#### Syntax:
```bash
until [ condition ]; do
    # Commands
done
```

#### Example:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
count=1
until [ $count -gt 5 ]; do
    echo "Count: $count"
    count=$((count + 1))
done
```

---

### 7. `for` Loop
The `for` loop iterates over a list of items.

#### Syntax:
```bash
for var in list; do
    # Commands
done
```

#### Example:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
for name in Alice Bob Charlie; do
    echo "Hello, $name!"
done
```

---

## Regular Expressions in Shell

Regular expressions (regex) are patterns used to match text. In shell scripting, regex is often used with tools like `grep`, `sed`, or `awk`.

#### Example: Regex with `grep`
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Enter a string:"
read string
if [[ $string =~ ^[A-Z][a-z]+$ ]]; then
    echo "The string starts with an uppercase letter."
else
    echo "The string does not match the pattern."
fi
```

#### Common Regex Symbols:
| **Symbol**  | **Description**                  | **Example**                     |
|-------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| `.`         | Matches any single character.   | `a.c` matches `abc`, `aXc`.     |
| `^`         | Matches the start of a line.    | `^abc` matches `abc` at start.  |
| `$`         | Matches the end of a line.      | `xyz$` matches `xyz` at end.    |
| `*`         | Matches zero or more occurrences.| `ab*` matches `a`, `ab`, `abb`. |
| `[ ]`       | Matches any character in brackets.| `[a-c]` matches `a`, `b`, `c`.  |

---

## Arithmetic Expressions

Shell scripting supports arithmetic operations using the `(( ))` syntax or the `expr` command.

#### Example: Using `(( ))`
```bash
#!/bin/bash
a=10
b=5
sum=$((a + b))
echo "Sum: $sum"
```

#### Example: Using `expr`
```bash
#!/bin/bash
a=10
b=5
sum=$(expr $a + $b)
echo "Sum: $sum"
```

---

## More Examples in Shell Programming

### 1. Script to Check Even or Odd
```bash
#!/bin/bash
read -p "Enter a number: " num
if [ $((num % 2)) -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "$num is even."
else
    echo "$num is odd."
fi
```

---

### 2. Script to Find Factorial
```bash
#!/bin/bash
read -p "Enter a number: " num
factorial=1
for ((i = 1; i <= num; i++)); do
    factorial=$((factorial * i))
done
echo "Factorial of $num is $factorial."
```

---

### 3. Script to Display Prime Numbers
```bash
#!/bin/bash
read -p "Enter a number: " num
for ((i = 2; i <= num; i++)); do
    is_prime=1
    for ((j = 2; j < i; j++)); do
        if [ $((i % j)) -eq 0 ]; then
            is_prime=0
            break
        fi
    done
    if [ $is_prime -eq 1 ]; then
        echo "$i is a prime number."
    fi
done
```

---

### 4. Script for File Existence Check
```bash
#!/bin/bash
read -p "Enter the filename: " filename
if [ -e "$filename" ]; then
    echo "File $filename exists."
else
    echo "File $filename does not exist."
fi
```

# Process Management in Operating Systems

## Processes

### What is a Process?
A **process** is an instance of a program in execution. It includes:
- Program code
- Current activity (such as the program counter, registers, and variables)
- Allocated system resources (memory, files, and I/O devices)

|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**              | The CPU can be taken away from a process at any time.      | A process runs to completion once it starts execution.|
| **Control**                 | Controlled by the operating system.                       | Controlled by the process itself.                   |
| **Examples**                | Multitasking systems (Round-Robin scheduling).            | Batch processing systems.                           |
| **Advantages**              | Better responsiveness and fairness.                      | Simpler to implement.                               |
| **Disadvantages**           | Higher overhead due to frequent context switching.        | Inefficient if a process takes too long.            |

## Process Management

### Process Life Cycle

A process goes through several stages during its lifetime:

#### States in the Process Life Cycle:
1. **New**: Process is being created.
2. **Ready**: Process is ready to execute but waiting for CPU allocation.
3. **Running**: Process is executing on the CPU.
4. **Waiting**: Process is waiting for an I/O operation to complete.
5. **Terminated**: Process has finished execution.

### What are Schedulers?

Schedulers are components of the operating system that manage process execution by deciding:
- **Which process to run**
- **When to run**

#### Types of Schedulers:

| **Scheduler**      | **Purpose**                                                                                                                                   | **Frequency**          | **Example**                          |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Short-Term**     | Selects a process from the ready queue to execute on the CPU.                                                                                | Runs very frequently. | Round-Robin, Priority Scheduling.    |
| **Medium-Term**    | Temporarily removes processes from memory (swapping) to reduce CPU load.                                                                     | Runs occasionally.     | Used in systems with limited memory. |
| **Long-Term**      | Decides which processes to admit into the system for processing.                                                                              | Runs infrequently.     | Used in batch or job scheduling.     |

#### Comparison of Schedulers:

| **Aspect**         | **Short-Term Scheduler**            | **Medium-Term Scheduler**       | **Long-Term Scheduler**        |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| **Objective**       | CPU allocation.                   | Manage memory and CPU load.     | Admission of processes.         |
| **Run Frequency**   | High (milliseconds).              | Medium (seconds).               | Low (minutes or less).          |
| **Type of Systems** | Time-sharing systems.             | Systems with memory limitations.| Batch systems.                  |

### Code Snippet: Process Creation Using Fork in C
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main() {
    pid_t pid = fork();

    if (pid == 0) {
        printf("Child Process: PID = %d\n", getpid());
    } else {
        printf("Parent Process: PID = %d\n", getpid());
    }
    return 0;
}
```

---

### Examples of Schedulers

#### 1. Round-Robin Scheduling (Short-Term Scheduler)
- Each process is assigned a fixed time quantum.
- After the quantum expires, the process is preempted, and the next process in the queue is executed.

#### 2. Swapping Processes (Medium-Term Scheduler)
- A process is swapped out of memory to the disk to free up space for other processes.
- Example: Virtual memory systems.

#### 3. Job Scheduling (Long-Term Scheduler)
- Jobs are selected from a job queue for execution based on criteria like priority or deadlines.

# Process Scheduling and Management

## Process Scheduling Algorithms

Process scheduling algorithms determine the order in which processes are executed by the CPU. Below are the primary scheduling algorithms:

### 1. First Come First Serve (FCFS)
- **Definition**: Processes are executed in the order they arrive in the ready queue.
- **Advantages**:
  - Simple to implement.
  - No starvation.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Can cause the "convoy effect," where smaller processes are delayed by larger ones.
  - Performance can degrade significantly if a long process arrives first, leading to high waiting times for shorter processes.

#### Handling Different Workloads:
- **Short Processes**: FCFS handles workloads with mostly short processes well, as it minimizes waiting time.
- **Mix of Short and Long Processes**: When a long process arrives first, shorter processes may experience significant delays, leading to poor throughput and higher average waiting times.
- **Impact on Throughput**: The throughput decreases as longer processes occupy the CPU, blocking subsequent processes, which causes inefficiency in high-demand systems.

#### Example:
| **Process** | **Arrival Time** | **Burst Time** | **Completion Time** | **Turnaround Time (TAT)** | **Waiting Time (WT)** |
|-------------|------------------|----------------|-----------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------|
| P1          | 0                | 5              | 5                     | 5                         | 0                     |
| P2          | 1                | 3              | 8                     | 7                         | 4                     |
| P3          | 2                | 8              | 16                    | 14                        | 6                     |

**Formulas**:
- **Turnaround Time (TAT)**: `Completion Time - Arrival Time`
- **Waiting Time (WT)**: `Turnaround Time - Burst Time`

---

### 2. Shortest Job First (SJF)
- **Definition**: Processes with the shortest burst time are executed first.
- **Advantages**:
  - Minimizes average waiting time.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Not suitable for real-time systems.
  - Starvation of longer processes.

---

# Process Scheduling Algorithms

## 3. Priority Scheduling

### Definition

Processes are executed based on their priority. Higher priority processes are executed first.

### Advantages

- Suitable for critical tasks.

### Disadvantages

- Can cause starvation of low-priority processes.

### Example

| **Process** | **Arrival Time** | **Burst Time** | **Priority** | **Completion Time** | **Turnaround Time** | **Waiting Time** |
| ----------- | ---------------- | -------------- | ------------ | ------------------- | ------------------- | ---------------- |
| P1          | 0                | 8              | 3            | 8                   | 8                   | 0                |
| P2          | 1                | 4              | 1            | 12                  | 11                  | 7                |
| P3          | 2                | 9              | 2            | 21                  | 19                  | 10               |

### Step-by-Step Calculation

#### Order of Execution

- P1 executes first since it arrives at time 0.
- P2 (Highest priority: 1) executes next.
- P3 (Priority: 2) executes last.

#### Calculations

1. **P1**:
   - Completion Time = Arrival Time + Burst Time = 0 + 8 = **8**
   - Turnaround Time = Completion Time - Arrival Time = 8 - 0 = **8**
   - Waiting Time = Turnaround Time - Burst Time = 8 - 8 = **0**

2. **P2**:
   - Completion Time = Completion of P1 + Burst Time = 8 + 4 = **12**
   - Turnaround Time = Completion Time - Arrival Time = 12 - 1 = **11**
   - Waiting Time = Turnaround Time - Burst Time = 11 - 4 = **7**

3. **P3**:
   - Completion Time = Completion of P2 + Burst Time = 12 + 9 = **21**
   - Turnaround Time = Completion Time - Arrival Time = 21 - 2 = **19**
   - Waiting Time = Turnaround Time - Burst Time = 19 - 9 = **10**

---

## 4. Round Robin (RR)

### Definition

Each process is executed for a fixed time quantum in a cyclic order.

### Advantages

- Provides fairness and prevents starvation.

### Disadvantages

- High context-switching overhead.

### Example

| **Process** | **Arrival Time** | **Burst Time** | **Time Quantum = 4** | **Completion Time** | **Turnaround Time** | **Waiting Time** |
| ----------- | ---------------- | -------------- | -------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | ---------------- |
| P1          | 0                | 8              | 12                   | 12                  | 12                  | 4                |
| P2          | 1                | 4              | 5                    | 5                   | 4                   | 0                |
| P3          | 2                | 9              | 17                   | 17                  | 15                  | 6                |

### Step-by-Step Calculation

#### Time Slices

1. P1 executes from 0 to 4 (Remaining Burst = 4).
2. P2 executes from 4 to 8 (Remaining Burst = 0).
3. P3 executes from 8 to 12 (Remaining Burst = 5).
4. P1 executes from 12 to 16 (Remaining Burst = 0).
5. P3 executes from 16 to 17 (Remaining Burst = 0).

#### Completion Times

- **P1**: Completes at **12**.
- **P2**: Completes at **5**.
- **P3**: Completes at **17**.

#### Turnaround Time

- **P1**: Completion Time - Arrival Time = 12 - 0 = **12**.
- **P2**: Completion Time - Arrival Time = 5 - 1 = **4**.
- **P3**: Completion Time - Arrival Time = 17 - 2 = **15**.

#### Waiting Time

- **P1**: Turnaround Time - Burst Time = 12 - 8 = **4**.
- **P2**: Turnaround Time - Burst Time = 4 - 4 = **0**.
- **P3**: Turnaround Time - Burst Time = 15 - 9 = **6**.

| P1          | 0                | 5              | 9                    | 9                   | 4                |
| P2          | 1                | 3              | 7                    | 6                   | 3                |
| P3          | 2                | 8              | 14                   | 12                  | 4                |

#### Time Slices

1. P1 executes from 0 to 4 (Remaining Burst = 1).
2. P2 executes from 4 to 7 (Remaining Burst = 0).
3. P3 executes from 7 to 11 (Remaining Burst = 4).
4. P1 executes from 11 to 12 (Remaining Burst = 0).
5. P3 executes from 12 to 14 (Remaining Burst = 0).

#### Completion Times

- **P1**: Completes at **9**.
- **P2**: Completes at **7**.
- **P3**: Completes at **14**.

#### Turnaround Times

- **P1**: Completion Time - Arrival Time = 9 - 0 = **9**.
- **P2**: Completion Time - Arrival Time = 7 - 1 = **6**.
- **P3**: Completion Time - Arrival Time = 14 - 2 = **12**.

#### Waiting Times

### 5. Multilevel Queue Scheduling
- **Definition**: Processes are divided into different queues based on their priority or type.
- Example:
  - **System Queue**: Highest priority.
  - **Interactive Queue**: Medium priority.
  - **Batch Queue**: Lowest priority.

---

### Belady’s Anomaly
- **Definition**: An increase in the number of page frames can cause an increase in the number of page faults in FIFO page replacement.

#### Visual Representation:
Below is a flowchart that illustrates how Belady's Anomaly occurs with a reference string and two different frame sizes:

```plaintext
Reference String: 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

+-----------------------------+
| Start with 3 Frames        |
+-----------------------------+
|                            |
| Page Faults = 9            |
+-----------------------------+
| Add 1 Frame (Total = 4)    |
+-----------------------------+
|                            |
| Page Faults = 10           |
+-----------------------------+
|                            |
| Belady's Anomaly Occurs:   |
| More frames => More faults |
+-----------------------------+
```

- **Example**:
  - Reference String: `1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5`
  - Frames: 3 vs. 4
  - **With 3 Frames**: 9 Page Faults.
  - **With 4 Frames**: 10 Page Faults.

#### Table of Page Faults:
| **Step** | **Reference** | **3 Frames**           | **4 Frames**           |
|----------|---------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| 1        | 1             | 1 -                     | 1 -                     |
| 2        | 2             | 1, 2 -                 | 1, 2 -                 |
| 3        | 3             | 1, 2, 3 -             | 1, 2, 3 -             |
| 4        | 4             | 4 replaces 1 (fault)   | 4 replaces 1 (fault)   |

| ...      | ...           | ...                    | ...                    |
| Final    | Total Faults  | 9 Faults               | 10 Faults              |
- **Definition**: An increase in the number of page frames can cause an increase in the number of page faults in FIFO page replacement.
- **Example**:
  - Reference String: `1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5`

## Examples for Scheduling Algorithms

Below is an example to find the better-performing scheduler:

#### Scenario:
| **Process** | **Arrival Time** | **Burst Time** |
|-------------|------------------|----------------|
| P1          | 0                | 10             |
| P2          | 2                | 5              |
| P3          | 4                | 2              |

### FCFS Output
| **Metric**        | **P1** | **P2** | **P3** |
|--------------------|--------|--------|--------|
| Turnaround Time    | 10     | 13     | 15     |
| Waiting Time       | 0      | 8      | 13     |
| Average Turnaround | **12.66**                                    |
| Average Waiting    | **7.0**                                      |

#### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **P1**:
   - **Completion Time**: Process starts at time 0 (arrival) and runs for 10 units.
     - Completion Time = 0 + 10 = **10**.
   - **Turnaround Time**: Completion Time - Arrival Time = 10 - 0 = **10**.
   - **Waiting Time**: Turnaround Time - Burst Time = 10 - 10 = **0**.

2. **P2**:
   - **Completion Time**: Process starts after P1 finishes at time 10.
     - Completion Time = 10 (start) + 5 (burst) = **15**.
   - **Turnaround Time**: Completion Time - Arrival Time = 15 - 2 = **13**.
   - **Waiting Time**: Turnaround Time - Burst Time = 13 - 5 = **8**.

3. **P3**:
   - **Completion Time**: Process starts after P2 finishes at time 15.
     - Completion Time = 15 (start) + 2 (burst) = **17**.
   - **Turnaround Time**: Completion Time - Arrival Time = 17 - 4 = **15**.
   - **Waiting Time**: Turnaround Time - Burst Time = 15 - 2 = **13**.

**Formulas**:
- **Turnaround Time (TAT)**: `Completion Time - Arrival Time`
- **Waiting Time (WT)**: `Turnaround Time - Burst Time`

By following these calculations, FCFS averages a **Turnaround Time** of **12.66** and a **Waiting Time** of **7.0**.:
| **Metric**        | **P1** | **P2** | **P3** |
|--------------------|--------|--------|--------|
| Turnaround Time    | 10     | 13     | 15     |
| Waiting Time       | 0      | 8      | 13     |
| Average Turnaround | **12.66**                                    |
| Average Waiting    | **7.0**                                      |

### SJF Output:
| **Metric**        | **P1** | **P2** | **P3** |
|--------------------|--------|--------|--------|
| Turnaround Time    | 15     | 5      | 2      |
| Waiting Time       | 5      | 0      | 0      |
| Average Turnaround | **7.33**                                    |
| Average Waiting    | **1.66**                                    |

**Conclusion**: SJF performs better in this scenario.

## Process Creation Using `fork`, `waitpid`, and `exec`

### 1. `fork()`
- **Definition**: Creates a child process by duplicating the current process.
- **Return Value**:
  - `0`: In the child process.
  - `>0`: Process ID of the child in the parent process.
  - `<0`: Error in process creation.

#### Flowchart: Parent and Child Process Creation
Below is a flowchart that visually represents how `fork()` works:

```plaintext
Start
  |
  |-- fork() system call
  |
  +---------------------------+
  |                           |
Parent Process                Child Process
  |                           |
  |-- Executes parent code     |-- Executes child code
  |                           |
  +---------------------------+
            End
```

#### Example:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main() {
    pid_t pid = fork();

    if (pid == 0) {
        printf("Child Process: PID = %d
", getpid());
    } else {
        printf("Parent Process: PID = %d
", getpid());
    }
    return 0;
}
```

---

### 2. `waitpid()`
- **Definition**: Makes the parent process wait until a specific child process completes.
- **Syntax**:
```c
pid_t waitpid(pid_t pid, int *status, int options);
```

---

### 3. `exec()`
- **Definition**: Replaces the current process with a new program.
- **Variants**:
  - `execl`, `execp`, `execv`, `execvp`.

#### Example:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main() {
    execl("/bin/ls", "ls", NULL);
    return 0;
}
```

---

## Orphan and Zombie Processes

### 1. Orphan Processes
- **Definition**: A process whose parent has terminated but is still running.
- **Example**:
  - The `init` process adopts orphan processes.

#### Example:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main() {
    pid_t pid = fork();
    if (pid == 0) {
        sleep(10); // Orphan child
        printf("Child process becomes orphan.\n");
    } else {
        printf("Parent process exiting.\n");
    }
    return 0;
}
```

---

### 2. Zombie Processes
- **Definition**: A process that has completed execution but still has an entry in the process table.
- **Cause**: The parent did not call `wait()` to remove the process entry.

#### Diagram: Zombie Process in the Process Table
Below is a representation of the process table showing how a zombie process appears:

```plaintext
+-----------+------------+-------------+
| Process ID| State      | Parent PID  |
+-----------+------------+-------------+
| 101       | Running    | 100         |
| 102       | Zombie     | 100         |
| 103       | Sleeping   | 101         |
+-----------+------------+-------------+
```

  - **Process 102** has completed execution but remains in the table as a "zombie."
  - **Process 100 (Parent)** has not cleaned up by calling `wait()`.

#### Cleanup Process:
1. Parent process calls `wait()` or `waitpid()`.
2. OS removes the zombie process from the process table.
3. Resources held by the zombie process are released.

#### Example:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/wait.h>

int main() {
    pid_t pid = fork();
    if (pid == 0) {
        printf("Child process exiting.
");
    } else {
        sleep(10); // Simulate delay before cleanup
        wait(NULL); // Parent cleans up zombie process
        printf("Zombie process cleaned up.
");
    }
    return 0;
}
```
- **Definition**: A process that has completed execution but still has an entry in the process table.
- **Cause**: The parent did not call `wait()` to remove the process entry.

#### Example:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main() {
    pid_t pid = fork();
    if (pid == 0) {
        printf("Child process exiting.\n");
    } else {
        sleep(10); // Parent does not call wait()
        printf("Parent process did not clean up the child.\n");
    }
    return 0;
}
```

# Memory Management

## Types of Memories and the Need for Memory Management

### Types of Memories:
1. **Primary Memory (RAM)**:
   - High-speed memory directly accessible by the CPU.
   - Volatile, meaning data is lost when the system is powered off.

2. **Secondary Memory (HDD/SSD)**:
   - Non-volatile memory used for long-term storage.
   - Slower but capable of storing large amounts of data.

3. **Cache Memory**:
   - Small, high-speed memory located close to the CPU.
   - Stores frequently accessed data to reduce latency.

4. **Virtual Memory**:
   - Logical extension of primary memory using disk storage.
   - Enables execution of large programs by swapping data in and out of physical memory.

5. **Registers**:
   - Smallest and fastest type of memory, located within the CPU.
   - Stores immediate instructions and data.

### Need for Memory Management:
- **Efficient Utilization**: Ensures optimal use of available memory.
- **Process Isolation**: Prevents processes from interfering with each other's memory space.
- **Dynamic Allocation**: Allocates memory dynamically as per process requirements.
- **Security**: Protects sensitive data from unauthorized access.
- **Performance Optimization**: Reduces fragmentation and increases access speed.

---

## Continuous and Dynamic Allocation

### Continuous Allocation:
- Memory is allocated in contiguous blocks.
- Simple to implement but suffers from **fragmentation**.

### Dynamic Allocation:
- Memory is allocated as needed during runtime.
- Enables efficient use of memory but requires complex management algorithms.

| Allocation Type      | Advantages                    | Disadvantages                 |
|----------------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Continuous Allocation| Simple and predictable      | Leads to fragmentation        |
| Dynamic Allocation   | Flexible and efficient usage| Requires complex algorithms   |

---

## Memory Allocation Algorithms

### 1. **First Fit**:
- Allocates the first block of memory that is large enough.
- **Advantage**: Fast.
- **Disadvantage**: Leads to fragmentation over time.

### 2. **Best Fit**:
- Allocates the smallest block of memory that fits the requirement.
- **Advantage**: Reduces wasted space.
- **Disadvantage**: Slower due to the search for the best fit.

### 3. **Worst Fit**:
- Allocates the largest block of memory available.
- **Advantage**: Avoids small leftover spaces.
- **Disadvantage**: May lead to inefficient use of memory.

| Algorithm  | Efficiency   | Fragmentation Handling  |
|------------|--------------|-------------------------|
| First Fit  | Fast         | Poor                   |
| Best Fit   | Moderate     | Better                 |
| Worst Fit  | Slow         | Poor                   |

### Example

Consider memory blocks of sizes: **100KB**, **500KB**, **200KB**, and **300KB**.  
Process sizes: **212KB**, **417KB**, and **112KB**.

#### Strategy

| Strategy    | Allocation Order      |
|-------------|-----------------------|
| First Fit   | 200KB, 500KB          |
| Best Fit    | 300KB, 500KB          |
| Worst Fit   | 500KB, 500KB          |

---

## Compaction
- **Definition**: Process of combining fragmented memory blocks into a single contiguous block.
- **Purpose**: Reduces fragmentation and makes larger blocks available for allocation.

### Example:
Before compaction:
```
[Process A][Free][Process B][Free][Process C]
```
After compaction:
```
[Process A][Process B][Process C][Free]
```

---

## Internal and External Fragmentation

### Internal Fragmentation:
- Wasted memory within allocated blocks.
- Occurs when memory is allocated in fixed-size blocks larger than required.

### External Fragmentation:
- Wasted memory outside allocated blocks due to small free spaces.
- Prevents allocation of larger blocks even if the total free space is sufficient.

| Type                    | Cause                         | Solution                     |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Internal Fragmentation  | Fixed-size block allocation   | Use dynamic allocation      |
| External Fragmentation  | Non-contiguous allocation     | Use compaction or paging    |

---

## Segmentation

### What is Segmentation?
- Divides memory into variable-sized segments based on logical divisions such as functions or data structures.

### Hardware Requirements:
- **Segment Table**: Maps logical addresses to physical memory.
- **Base Register**: Stores the starting address of a segment.
- **Limit Register**: Stores the size of a segment.

### Segmentation Table:
| Segment | Base Address | Limit |
|---------|--------------|-------|
| 0       | 1000         | 500   |
| 1       | 2000         | 300   |
| 2       | 3000         | 800   |

### Interpretation:
- Logical addresses are translated into physical addresses using the base and limit values from the segmentation table.
- Address validation ensures access stays within segment boundaries.

---

## Paging

### What is Paging?
- Divides memory into fixed-size pages.
- Avoids external fragmentation by using equal-sized blocks for logical and physical memory.

### Hardware Requirements:
- **Page Table**: Maps logical pages to physical frames.
- **Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB)**: Cache for page table entries to speed up address translation.

### Paging Table Example:
| Logical Page | Physical Frame |
|--------------|----------------|
| 0            | 2              |
| 1            | 5              |
| 2            | 8              |

### Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB):
- High-speed memory used to store a subset of page table entries.
- Reduces the time needed for address translation.

---

## Concept of Dirty Bit
- **Definition**: A flag in a page table entry indicating whether the associated page has been modified.
- **Purpose**: Ensures that only modified pages are written back to disk, optimizing performance.
- **Example**:
  - If a page is modified (dirty bit = 1), it is saved to disk before being replaced.
  - If not modified (dirty bit = 0), no save operation is needed.

---

## Shared Pages and Reentrant Code

### Shared Pages:
- Allows multiple processes to share common code or data.
- Reduces memory usage by avoiding duplication.

### Reentrant Code:
- Code that can be safely executed by multiple processes concurrently.
- Example: Shared libraries loaded into memory once and used by multiple programs.

---

## Throttling
- **Definition**: Controlling the rate at which a process uses system resources to prevent overloading.
- **Purpose**:
  - Balances resource usage across processes.
  - Prevents bottlenecks and system degradation.

### Example:
- Limiting the bandwidth of a process to ensure fair usage in a networked environment.

---

## IO Management

### Overview:
- Manages input/output operations between the system and peripherals such as disks, printers, and keyboards.
- Ensures smooth data transfer and synchronization.

### Techniques:
| Technique  | Description                            |
|------------|----------------------------------------|
| Buffering  | Temporary storage during IO transfers |
| Caching    | Storing frequently accessed data      |
| Spooling   | Queuing jobs for sequential execution |

### Components:
- **Device Drivers**: Software interfaces for communication with hardware devices.
- **Interrupt Handlers**: Manage IO operation notifications.
- **IO Scheduler**: Optimizes the order of IO requests to enhance performance.

# Virtual Memory

Virtual memory is a memory management technique that provides an "illusion" of a larger main memory by abstracting physical memory into a virtual address space. It allows programs to use more memory than is physically available in RAM by utilizing disk storage for data that isn't actively in use.

## Features of Virtual Memory
1. **Logical Addressing:** Virtual addresses are translated to physical addresses through the Memory Management Unit (MMU).
2. **Demand Paging:** Only the required data/pages are loaded into physical memory, reducing memory usage.
3. **Isolation:** Each process operates within its own virtual address space.
4. **Efficient Multitasking:** Allows many processes to run simultaneously by swapping data in and out of memory.

---

## Demand Paging

**Demand paging** is a memory management scheme where pages are loaded into memory only when they are required. If a page isn't present in physical memory when a program accesses it, a **page fault** occurs, and the operating system loads the required page from disk into memory.

### Steps in Demand Paging
1. The program references a page using a virtual address.
2. If the page is not in memory (page fault), the OS:
   - Identifies the required page.
   - Finds a free frame in memory or evicts an existing page.
   - Loads the page from secondary storage (disk).
   - Updates the page table.
3. Execution resumes after the page is loaded.

---

## Page Faults

A **page fault** occurs when a program accesses a page that is not currently in physical memory. This triggers the operating system to fetch the missing page from disk.

### Types of Page Faults
1. **Minor Page Fault:** The page is in memory but not mapped into the process's page table.
2. **Major Page Fault:** The page must be retrieved from secondary storage.
3. **Invalid Page Fault:** Occurs when a program accesses a non-existent or restricted page.

### Handling a Page Fault
1. Determine the missing page using the virtual address.
2. Check the disk location of the page.
3. Allocate a frame in physical memory.
4. Load the page into the allocated frame.
5. Update the process's page table.
6. Resume execution.

---

## Page Replacement Algorithms

When a page fault occurs and memory is full, the OS must decide which page to replace using a **page replacement algorithm**.

### 1. FIFO (First-In-First-Out)
- The oldest page in memory is replaced.
- Simple but may lead to poor performance (e.g., Belady's anomaly).

#### Example
```plaintext
Pages: [1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Frames: 3
FIFO: [1, 2, 3] -> [4, 1, 2] -> [5, 1, 2] -> [3, 4, 5]
Page Faults: 9
```

### 2. LRU (Least Recently Used)
- Replaces the page that has not been used for the longest time.
- More efficient but requires tracking page usage.

#### Example
```plaintext
Pages: [1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Frames: 3
LRU: [1, 2, 3] -> [4, 1, 2] -> [5, 4, 1] -> [3, 5, 1]
Page Faults: 8
```

### 3. Optimal
- Replaces the page that won’t be used for the longest time in the future.
- Theoretical best performance but requires knowledge of future accesses.

#### Example
```plaintext
Pages: [1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Frames: 3
Optimal: [1, 2, 3] -> [4, 1, 2] -> [5, 4, 1] -> [3, 4, 5]
Page Faults: 7
```

### 4. Clock Algorithm
- Circular implementation of LRU using a "use" bit.
- Pages are replaced in a circular manner, skipping pages with their "use" bit set to `1`.

+-------------------------+
         MMU
+-------------------------+
|     Physical Memory     | <- Physical Address
+-------------------------+
```

### Page Table Example
| Virtual Page | Physical Frame | Valid Bit |
|--------------|----------------|-----------|
| 0            | 3              | 1         |
| 1            | 5              | 1         |
| 2            | -              | 0         |
| 3            | 1              | 1         |

## Code Snippets

### Simulating FIFO in Python
```python
def fifo(pages, frames):
    memory = []
    page_faults = 0
    
    for page in pages:
        if page not in memory:
            page_faults += 1
            if len(memory) < frames:
                memory.append(page)
            else:
                memory.pop(0)
                memory.append(page)
        print(f"Memory: {memory}")
    
    return page_faults

pages = [1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
frames = 3
faults = fifo(pages, frames)
print(f"Total Page Faults: {faults}")
```
