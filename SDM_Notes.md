## DevOps Phases
DevOps phases can be represented as part of a continuous loop called the **DevOps Infinity Loop**. These phases include:

1. **Plan:** Define objectives and requirements.
2. **Develop:** Write and build code.
3. **Build:** Compile and integrate code.
4. **Test:** Validate functionality and performance.
5. **Release:** Package the application for deployment.
6. **Deploy:** Deploy the application in production.
7. **Operate:** Monitor and manage the production environment.
8. **Monitor:** Analyze logs and gather feedback for improvement.

## Introduction to Containerization
**Containerization** is the process of bundling an application and its dependencies into a single lightweight package called a **container**. Containers are isolated from each other but share the same operating system kernel, making them portable and efficient.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3ff274eb-e3d4-491b-b9d6-4b60ca386876)

### Benefits of Containerization
1. **Portability:** Run containers on any environment (e.g., development, staging, production).
2. **Resource Efficiency:** Containers use fewer resources compared to virtual machines.
3. **Isolation:** Applications in containers run independently, reducing conflicts.

---

## Introduction to Docker
**Docker** is an open-source platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers. It simplifies container creation and management.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f40a5d62-0548-4110-a970-07f1816c752c)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4ab7bba4-d9fb-438a-8680-a38cabcaa42e)

### Key Components of Docker
1. **Docker Engine:** Core runtime for managing containers.
2. **Docker Images:** Templates used to create containers.
3. **Docker Containers:** Running instances of Docker images.
4. **Docker Hub:** A repository for sharing and storing Docker images.

---

## Creating Docker Images Using Dockerfile
A **Dockerfile** is a text file containing instructions to build a Docker image.

### Steps to Create a Docker Image
1. **Write a Dockerfile:**

   Example:
   ```dockerfile
   # Base Image
   FROM python:3.9-slim
   
   # Set Working Directory
   WORKDIR /app
   
   # Copy Application Code
   COPY . /app
   
   # Install Dependencies
   RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
   
   # Expose Port
   EXPOSE 5000
   
   # Run Application
   CMD ["python", "app.py"]
   ```

2. **Build the Docker Image:**
   ```bash
   docker build -t my-python-app .
   ```

3. **Run the Docker Container:**
   ```bash
   docker run -p 5000:5000 my-python-app
   ```

---

## Container Life Cycle
The life cycle of a container involves the following states:

1. **Created:** The container is created but not running.
2. **Running:** The container is executing the specified process.
3. **Paused:** The containerâ€™s processes are paused.
4. **Stopped:** The container is stopped but still exists.
5. **Deleted:** The container is removed from the system.

### Container Management Commands
- **List Running Containers:**
  ```bash
  docker ps
  ```
- **Stop a Container:**
  ```bash
  docker stop <container_id>
  ```
- **Remove a Container:**
  ```bash
  docker rm <container_id>
  ```

# **Introduction to YAML**

**YAML** (YAML Ain't Markup Language) is a human-readable data serialization standard used for configuration files and data exchange between programming languages. It is widely used in DevOps tools like Kubernetes, Ansible, and Docker Compose.

## **Features of YAML**
- **Human-friendly:** Designed to be easy to read and write.
- **Indentation-based:** Uses indentation to represent data hierarchy.
- **Data serialization:** Supports mapping, sequences, and scalars.
- **Language-agnostic:** Compatible with multiple programming languages.

## **YAML Syntax**
### 1. Scalars (Strings, Numbers, Booleans):
```yaml
name: John Doe
age: 30
is_developer: true
```

### 2. Lists (Sequences):
```yaml
skills:
  - Python
  - Java
  - Docker
```

### 3. Mappings (Dictionaries):
```yaml
address:
  street: 123 Main St
  city: Example City
```

### 4. Nested Structures:
```yaml
employee:
  name: Jane
  role:
    department: IT
    title: Engineer
```

## **YAML in DevOps**
### Docker Compose File Example:
```yaml
version: "3.8"
services:
  web:
    image: nginx
    ports:
      - "80:80"
  db:
    image: mysql
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: example
```

# **Introduction to Docker Swarm and Docker Stack**

## **Docker Swarm**
**Docker Swarm** is a native clustering and orchestration tool for Docker containers. It allows you to manage a group of Docker hosts as a single virtual server.

### **Key Features of Docker Swarm**
1. **Decentralized Design:** Nodes in a swarm can act as managers or workers.
2. **Service Discovery:** Automatically assigns tasks to nodes.
3. **Scaling:** Scale up or down services easily.
4. **Fault Tolerance:** Redistributes workloads if a node fails.

## **Docker Stack**
**Docker Stack** is a higher-level abstraction over Docker Swarm that uses a YAML-based configuration file (`docker-compose.yml`) to deploy multi-container applications.

### **Example: Deploying a Stack**
1. Create a `docker-compose.yml` file:
   ```yaml
   version: "3.8"
   services:
     web:
       image: nginx
       ports:
         - "80:80"
   ```
2. Deploy the stack:
   ```bash
   docker stack deploy -c docker-compose.yml my_stack
   ```

metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:1.21
```

### 2. Expose as a service:
```bash
kubectl expose deployment nginx-deployment --type=LoadBalancer --name=nginx-service
```

### 3. View service:
