## Introduction to Git Repository and Git Structure

A **Git repository** is a storage space for your project, including:
1. **Working Directory:** Contains files currently being worked on.
2. **Staging Area:** Holds files that will be included in the next commit.
3. **Repository:** Stores all the committed changes.

| **Component**  | **Description**                                                                |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `.git/`         | Hidden folder storing Git metadata.                                           |
| `HEAD`          | Points to the current branch.                                                 |
| `index`         | Tracks files in the staging area.                                             |

---

## Adding Code to Git
1. **Initialize Repository:**
   ```bash
   git init
   ```
2. **Stage Changes:**
   ```bash
   git add <file>
   ```
3. **Commit Changes:**
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Your commit message"
   ```

---

## Creating and Merging Different Git Branches
1. **Create a Branch:**
   ```bash
   git branch feature-branch
   git checkout feature-branch
   ```

2. **Merge Branch:**
   - Switch to the main branch:
     ```bash
     git checkout main
     ```
   - Merge the feature branch:
     ```bash
     git merge feature-branch
     ```

3. **Resolve Merge Conflicts:**
   - Open conflicting files.
   - Resolve conflicts manually.
   - Stage the resolved files and commit:
     ```bash
     git add <file>
     git commit -m "Resolved merge conflicts"
     ```

# Software Engineering Topics: Requirements and Design

## Requirements Engineering
Requirements Engineering is the process of defining, documenting, and maintaining the requirements for a software project.

### Types of Requirements
1. **Functional Requirements:** Define the functionalities the system must perform.
2. **Non-Functional Requirements:** Specify the quality attributes or constraints of the system.
3. **Domain Requirements:** Capture specific constraints or rules from the application domain.
4. **Business Requirements:** High-level objectives of the organization or client.

### Steps in Requirements Engineering
1. **Requirements Elicitation:** Gather requirements through interviews, surveys, and observation.
2. **Requirements Analysis:** Identify conflicts, refine requirements, and assess feasibility.
3. **Requirements Specification:** Document the requirements in a clear and structured format.
4. **Requirements Validation:** Ensure the documented requirements meet stakeholder needs.
5. **Requirements Management:** Maintain and track requirements throughout the development lifecycle.

### Requirement Analysis Modelling
- **Use Case Diagrams:** Capture interactions between users and the system.
- **Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs):** Represent data movement within the system.
- **Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERDs):** Model data relationships.
- **Class Diagrams:** Show system classes and their relationships.

---

## Design and Architectural Engineering

### Characteristics of Good Design
1. **Clarity:** Easy to understand and communicate.
2. **Flexibility:** Adapts to future changes.
3. **Reusability:** Promotes reuse of components.
4. **Efficiency:** Optimally uses resources.
5. **Scalability:** Handles increasing demands effectively.

### Function-Oriented vs Object-Oriented Systems
| **Aspect**             | **Function-Oriented System**              | **Object-Oriented System**                  |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Focus**              | Functions or procedures.                  | Objects and their interactions.            |
| **Modularity**         | Based on functional decomposition.        | Based on objects encapsulating data/behavior.|
| **Reusability**        | Limited to procedural reuse.              | High due to object inheritance/polymorphism.|
| **Design Representation**| Data Flow Diagrams (DFD).               | Unified Modeling Language (UML).           |

### Key Concepts
1. **Modularity:** Dividing the system into smaller, manageable modules.
2. **Cohesion:** Degree to which elements within a module are related. (Higher cohesion = Better module design.)
3. **Coupling:** Measure of interdependence between modules. (Lower coupling = Better design.)
4. **Layering:** Structuring a system into layers (e.g., Presentation, Business Logic, Data Access).

### Design Models
1. **Architectural Models:** Define system components and their interactions.
2. **Component Models:** Represent individual modules.
3. **Dynamic Models:** Show system behavior over time (e.g., state diagrams).
4. **Deployment Models:** Illustrate physical deployment of components.

### Unified Modeling Language (UML)
- **Class Diagrams:** Represent classes and their relationships.
- **Sequence Diagrams:** Show interactions between objects over time.
- **Activity Diagrams:** Depict workflows.
- **State Diagrams:** Represent states and transitions of objects.

---

## Coding

### Programming Principles
1. **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):** Avoid code duplication.
2. **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid):** Simplify code as much as possible.
3. **SOLID Principles:** Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion.

### Coding Conventions
1. Use meaningful variable names.
2. Follow consistent indentation.
3. Write comments for complex logic.
4. Adhere to naming conventions (e.g., camelCase for variables, PascalCase for classes).

---

## Object-Oriented Analysis and Design

### Steps in OOAD
1. **Identify Objects:** Determine entities relevant to the system.
2. **Define Relationships:** Establish relationships between objects.
3. **Design Class Hierarchies:** Use inheritance and polymorphism.
4. **Model System Behavior:** Use sequence diagrams, state diagrams, and activity diagrams.
