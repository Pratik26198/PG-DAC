## Issues Developers Face When Working in a Team

| **Category**           | **Issues**                                                                                     | **Solutions**                                                                      |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Communication           | Misunderstanding requirements or unclear instructions.                                        | Regular meetings, clear documentation, and tools like Slack or Microsoft Teams.    |
| Code Conflicts          | Overwriting each otherâ€™s code or resolving merge conflicts.                                   | Proper branch management and frequent commits with pull requests.                 |
| Different Skill Levels  | Varying levels of expertise leading to uneven task distribution.                              | Assign tasks based on skill and provide mentorship.                               |
| Integration Problems    | Issues when integrating individual components.                                                | Define clear integration points and conduct frequent testing.                     |
| Time Zone Differences   | Challenges in collaboration for distributed teams.                                            | Use asynchronous communication tools and schedule overlapping work hours.         |

## Introduction to Code Versioning System
A **Code Versioning System** (CVS) is a tool that helps developers track and manage changes to source code over time.

### Key Benefits:
- **Version History:** Keeps a record of changes.
- **Collaboration:** Allows multiple developers to work on the same project.
- **Backup:** Ensures code safety in case of errors.

## History of Code Versioning System

| **Year** | **Tool/Concept**        | **Description**                                                                              |
|----------|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1972     | SCCS                    | First version control system; allowed basic tracking.                                        |
| 1982     | RCS                     | Introduced deltas to track changes.                                                         |
| 1990s    | CVS                     | Enabled concurrent editing and branching.                                                   |
| 2000     | Subversion (SVN)        | Improved upon CVS with better atomic commits and branching.                                 |
| 2005     | Git                     | Introduced distributed version control, speed, and powerful branching.                      |

### Different Tools for Versioning
1. **Git:** Open-source, distributed.
2. **SVN:** Centralized versioning system.
3. **Mercurial:** Similar to Git, distributed and user-friendly.
4. **Perforce:** Enterprise-grade versioning.

---

## Software Development Workflow
A typical **Git-based workflow**:
1. **Planning:** Requirements are gathered and tasks are divided.
2. **Branching:** Developers create branches for features.
3. **Coding:** Code is written and committed.
4. **Code Review:** Pull requests are reviewed by peers.
5. **Testing:** Automated or manual testing.
6. **Merging:** Code is merged into the main branch.
7. **Deployment:** CI/CD pipelines deploy the code.

## Introduction to Git
Git is a **distributed version control system** created by Linus Torvalds in 2005.

### Core Features:
- Branching and Merging.
- Distributed architecture.
- Data Integrity.

## Introduction to Git Repository and Git Structure

A **Git repository** is a storage space for your project, including:
1. **Working Directory:** Contains files currently being worked on.
2. **Staging Area:** Holds files that will be included in the next commit.
3. **Repository:** Stores all the committed changes.

| **Component**  | **Description**                                                                |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `.git/`         | Hidden folder storing Git metadata.                                           |
| `HEAD`          | Points to the current branch.                                                 |
| `index`         | Tracks files in the staging area.                                             |

---

## Adding Code to Git
1. **Initialize Repository:**
   ```bash
   git init
   ```
2. **Stage Changes:**
   ```bash
   git add <file>
   ```
3. **Commit Changes:**
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Your commit message"
   ```

---

## Creating and Merging Different Git Branches
1. **Create a Branch:**
   ```bash
   git branch feature-branch
   git checkout feature-branch
   ```

2. **Merge Branch:**
   - Switch to the main branch:
     ```bash
     git checkout main
     ```
   - Merge the feature branch:
     ```bash
     git merge feature-branch
     ```

3. **Resolve Merge Conflicts:**
   - Open conflicting files.
   - Resolve conflicts manually.
   - Stage the resolved files and commit:
     ```bash
     git add <file>
     git commit -m "Resolved merge conflicts"
     ```
