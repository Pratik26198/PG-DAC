## Introduction to Containerization
**Containerization** is the process of bundling an application and its dependencies into a single lightweight package called a **container**. Containers are isolated from each other but share the same operating system kernel, making them portable and efficient.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3ff274eb-e3d4-491b-b9d6-4b60ca386876)

### Benefits of Containerization
1. **Portability:** Run containers on any environment (e.g., development, staging, production).
2. **Resource Efficiency:** Containers use fewer resources compared to virtual machines.
3. **Isolation:** Applications in containers run independently, reducing conflicts.

---

## Introduction to Docker
**Docker** is an open-source platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers. It simplifies container creation and management.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f40a5d62-0548-4110-a970-07f1816c752c)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4ab7bba4-d9fb-438a-8680-a38cabcaa42e)

### Key Components of Docker
1. **Docker Engine:** Core runtime for managing containers.
2. **Docker Images:** Templates used to create containers.
3. **Docker Containers:** Running instances of Docker images.
4. **Docker Hub:** A repository for sharing and storing Docker images.

---

## Creating Docker Images Using Dockerfile
A **Dockerfile** is a text file containing instructions to build a Docker image.

### Steps to Create a Docker Image
1. **Write a Dockerfile:**

   Example:
   ```dockerfile
   # Base Image
   FROM python:3.9-slim
   
   # Set Working Directory
   WORKDIR /app
   
   # Copy Application Code
   COPY . /app
   
   # Install Dependencies
   RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
   
   # Expose Port
   EXPOSE 5000
   
   # Run Application
   CMD ["python", "app.py"]
   ```

2. **Build the Docker Image:**
   ```bash
   docker build -t my-python-app .
   ```

3. **Run the Docker Container:**
   ```bash
   docker run -p 5000:5000 my-python-app
   ```

---

## Container Life Cycle
The life cycle of a container involves the following states:

1. **Created:** The container is created but not running.
2. **Running:** The container is executing the specified process.
3. **Paused:** The containerâ€™s processes are paused.
4. **Stopped:** The container is stopped but still exists.
5. **Deleted:** The container is removed from the system.

### Container Management Commands
- **List Running Containers:**
  ```bash
  docker ps
  ```
- **Stop a Container:**
  ```bash
  docker stop <container_id>
  ```
- **Remove a Container:**
  ```bash
  docker rm <container_id>
  ```

- **Indentation-based:** Uses indentation to represent data hierarchy.
- **Data serialization:** Supports mapping, sequences, and scalars.
- **Language-agnostic:** Compatible with multiple programming languages.

## **YAML Syntax**
### 1. Scalars (Strings, Numbers, Booleans):
```yaml
name: John Doe
age: 30
is_developer: true
```

### 2. Lists (Sequences):
```yaml
skills:
  - Python
  - Java
  - Docker
```

### 3. Mappings (Dictionaries):
```yaml
address:
  street: 123 Main St
  city: Example City
```

### 4. Nested Structures:
```yaml
employee:
  name: Jane
  role:
    department: IT
    title: Engineer
```

## **YAML in DevOps**

# **Introduction to Docker Swarm and Docker Stack**

## **Docker Swarm**
**Docker Swarm** is a native clustering and orchestration tool for Docker containers. It allows you to manage a group of Docker hosts as a single virtual server.

### **Key Features of Docker Swarm**
1. **Decentralized Design:** Nodes in a swarm can act as managers or workers.
2. **Service Discovery:** Automatically assigns tasks to nodes.
3. **Scaling:** Scale up or down services easily.
4. **Fault Tolerance:** Redistributes workloads if a node fails.

## **Docker Stack**
**Docker Stack** is a higher-level abstraction over Docker Swarm that uses a YAML-based configuration file (`docker-compose.yml`) to deploy multi-container applications.

### **Example: Deploying a Stack**
1. Create a `docker-compose.yml` file:
   ```yaml
   version: "3.8"
   services:
     web:
       image: nginx
       ports:
         - "80:80"
   ```
2. Deploy the stack:
   ```bash
   docker stack deploy -c docker-compose.yml my_stack
   ```

# Introduction to Software Testing

## Definition
Software testing is the process of evaluating and verifying that a software product or application performs as intended. It involves executing a system or its components to identify any gaps, errors, or missing requirements in contrast to the actual requirements.

## Key Objectives
1. **Verification of Requirements**: Ensures the software meets the business and technical requirements.
2. **Bug Detection**: Identifies and fixes defects.
3. **Reliability Assessment**: Checks the softwareâ€™s stability, scalability, and performance.
4. **User Satisfaction**: Ensures the software delivers value to its end users.

## Types of Software Testing
- **Manual Testing**: Testing performed by human testers without automation tools.
- **Automated Testing**: Testing carried out using automated tools like Selenium, JUnit, etc.

### Example
For a login module, testers verify if:
1. Correct credentials allow access.
2. Incorrect credentials show an error.
3. Password masking works.

---

# Why Testing Code is Important

## Importance
1. **Error Detection**: Identifies bugs early to reduce cost and time.
2. **Product Quality**: Ensures the product meets user expectations and performs reliably.
3. **User Experience**: Avoids user dissatisfaction due to crashes or inconsistencies.
4. **Compliance**: Adheres to industry and regulatory standards.
5. **Business Continuity**: Avoids financial loss due to downtime or malfunction.

## Cost of Defects
Defects detected during the design phase cost significantly less than those found post-release.

| **Phase**       | **Relative Cost to Fix a Bug** |
|------------------|-------------------------------|
| Design          | 1x                            |
| Development     | 5x                            |
| Testing         | 10x                           |
| Post-release    | 100x                          |

---

# Verification and Validation

## Verification
- **Definition**: Checks if the product is built correctly as per the design and specifications.
- **Purpose**: Focuses on **processes**.
- **Techniques**:
  - Reviews
  - Inspections
  - Walkthroughs

## Validation
- **Definition**: Ensures the product fulfills the intended use and requirements.
- **Purpose**: Focuses on the **product**.
- **Techniques**:

# Quality Assurance vs Quality Control vs Testing

## Quality Assurance (QA)
- **Definition**: A proactive process focusing on improving the development process to prevent defects.
- **Key Features**:
  - Process-oriented
  - Preventative
  - Examples: Standards compliance, process improvement

## Quality Control (QC)
- **Definition**: A reactive process that focuses on identifying defects in the final product.
- **Key Features**:
  - Product-oriented
  - Detects defects
  - Examples: Product inspection, defect testing

## Testing
- **Definition**: Part of QC; involves executing a program to find bugs.
- **Key Features**:
  - Product-specific
  - Involves test cases and tools

| **Aspect**      | **QA**                  | **QC**                | **Testing**             |
|------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------|
| Focus            | Process improvement     | Defect identification | Bug finding             |
| Approach         | Proactive               | Reactive              | Reactive                |
| Example          | Implementing standards  | Conducting reviews    | Running test scripts    |

# Principles of Software Testing

## 1. Testing Shows Presence of Defects
- **Principle**: Testing can prove that defects exist but cannot confirm their absence.
- **Example**: A passed test case does not guarantee the system is 100% defect-free.

## 2. Exhaustive Testing is Impossible
- **Principle**: Testing every possible input/output combination is infeasible.
- **Example**: For a form with 5 input fields, testing all combinations would require enormous effort.

## 3. Early Testing Saves Time and Cost
- **Principle**: Start testing in the early stages (requirements and design phase).
- **Example**: Detecting design flaws during the design phase avoids costly rework.

## 4. Defect Clustering
- **Principle**: A small number of modules contain the majority of defects.
- **Example**: A single function might account for 80% of the crashes.

## 5. Pesticide Paradox
- **Principle**: Repeatedly running the same tests will not discover new bugs.
- **Solution**: Regularly update test cases.

## 6. Testing is Context Dependent
- **Principle**: Testing varies based on the application type (e.g., web, mobile, IoT).
- **Example**: A banking app requires stricter testing than a social media app.

## 7. Absence-of-Errors Fallacy
- **Principle**: Even if software has no bugs, it may not meet user needs.
- **Example**: A calculator app without a percent feature fails user expectations.
